GOAL OF PROBLEM:
Return array indx where everything to LEFT and RIGHT of indx is strictly less and greater than (respectively) the value at the indx position

Note: This submission passed on Geoff's "testClassDesign, "testSimpleInputs", and "testRandomInputs"
---
Fails when any non-zero value is situated at an indx > arrayMidpt
	-> Ex: Input: values = {0, 0, 0, 2, 0}
		Intermediate result: values = {0, 0, 0, 0, 0}
		Final result: pivotPosition = 0
		Expected intermediate result: values = {0, 0, 0, 0, 2}
		Expected final result: pivotPosition = 4
