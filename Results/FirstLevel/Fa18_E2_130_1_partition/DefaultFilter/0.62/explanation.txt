GOAL OF PROBLEM:
Return array indx where everything to LEFT and RIGHT of indx is strictly less and greater than (respectively) the value at the indx position

Note: This submission passed on Geoff's "testClassDesign, "testSimpleInputs", and "testRandomInputs"
---
Fails when 2+ adjacent elements have the same non-zero value, regardless of how far these two elements are offset from the beginning of the array
	-> Ex: Input: values = {1023, 1023, 0} 
		Intermediate result: values = {1023, 1023, 1023}
		Final result: pivotPosition = 0
		Expected intermediate result: values = {0, 1023, 1023}
		Expected final result: pivotPosition = 1
